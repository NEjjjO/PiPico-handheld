# PiPico-handheld
Developing on Hari Waguna's original Pi Pico snake game, I designed a small PCB for the game and development on more games is in progress


Hold down the "BOOTSEL" button on your Pico when yyou plug it into your computer (only if you are connecting it for the first time).
It should appear as a removable storage device. Drag the UF2 file onto it and wait for the Pi to reboot.

Then, open Thonny.

Just connect your Rpi Pico to Thonny (in Tools > Interpreter > and choose the Rpi Pico as a Micropython interpreter), Download the ssd1306 OLED driver from the package manager, save the game of your choice as "main.py" and there you go!



PCB Gerber files coming soon.
