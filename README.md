# PiPico-handheld
Developing on Hari Waguna's original Pi Pico snake game, I designed a small PCB for the game and development on more games is in progress

Just connect your Rpi Pico to Thonny, download the ssd1306 OLED driver from the package manager, save the game of your choice as "main.py" and there you go!
PCB Gerber files coming soon.
